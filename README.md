Four students' attempt at "helping" a client in their research. We will not succeed

## A List of all the files

- **original.csv** Contains the original, unadulterated data set with an added variable called ID that acts as the primary key for individuals
- **wider.csv** Contains a transformed data set which satisfy the independent observations assumption; it contains all three variables of interest, as estimated directly from the data
- **EDA.rmd** Rmd file that produced all the diagnostic plots
- **Model.rmd** Rmd file that (supposedly) produced the models

## A quick note

The client is interested in "Maximum concentration, lag time, and mu_max". These values will be collectively referred to as the characteristic values throughout this project.
